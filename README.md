Say goodbye to dry plants and hello to bnbPlants: the witty, moisture-measuring marvel that keeps your green companions hydrated! bnbPlants measures soil moisture, offers a dashboard, and sends witty reminders to water your plants.

# Introduction
Discover the fascinating world of IoT with "bnbPlants," a project that originated during the summer course at Linnaeus University in 2023. This system effectively measures soil moisture and temperature, and intelligently predicts the watering needs of your plants. The Raspberry Pi Pico serves as the core component, ensuring optimal growth and hydration for every plant in your garden.

# Objective
The "bnbPlants" project arose from a challenge faced by my mother in caring for the plants at our family's Airbnb property during the off-season summer months. Uncertain watering schedules led to stress and inefficiency. To tackle this issue, "bnbPlants" introduces a soil moisture system that not only monitors soil conditions and temperature but also predicts when the next watering is required. The project includes a user-friendly online dashboard, accessible at any time and from anywhere, providing real-time updates on the plants' needs. Additionally, it will send notifications via Telegram to the user when it's time to water the plants, making the task of plant care effortless and precise even for non-tech savvy individuals.
